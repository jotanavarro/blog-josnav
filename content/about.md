title: "About me"
---

I am a software engineer based in Prague, the beautiful capital of the Czech Republic who likes Unix-like systems, functional programming. I also consider myself a coffee aficionado.

Currently I work at [Accolade Inc](https://accolade.com), contributing to the monitoring and observability platform.  It is a great place to work at with a fantastic mission, we are usually recruiting... so check the site!

I am also [a photography enthusiast](https://www.instagram.com/jlnav/), although I am no longer very active.  In the future I would like to have my own darkroom and join the ranks of the _true_ photographers.
